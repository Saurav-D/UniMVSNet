# UniMVSNet
UniMVSNet is a learning-based multi-view stereo model, which has a unified depth representation to not only achieve sub-pixel depth estimation but also constrain the cost volume directly.
To excavate the potential of our novel representation, we designed a Unified Focal Loss to combat the challenge of sample imbalance more reasonably and uniformly.
